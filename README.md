# VRV Securityâ€™s Backend Developer Intern Assignment (Bhautik Prajapati)

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Overview

This project implements a simple yet secure Authentication and Authorization system with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It allows users to register, log in, and log out securely, while also ensuring that users are granted appropriate access to resources based on their assigned roles (Admin, Moderator, User). The system uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for managing sessions and securing endpoints.
 
## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** (v14 or above)
- **Express.js**
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken** for JWT token management
